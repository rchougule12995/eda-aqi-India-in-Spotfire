# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Air Quality Data of cities in India with TIBCO Spotfire

The source of the Data is Real time Air Quality Index from various locations.
The Real-time Air Quality Index of different monitoring stations across India is obtained by the API provided by the Ministry of Environment & Forests, India and Central Pollution Control Board, India. The API gives the real-time data for the hour which has the list of monitored pollutants like Carbon Monoxide(CO), Sulphur Dioxide(SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide(NO2), Particulate Matter(PM10 and PM2.5) and Ozone(O3). The stations monitor Air pollution from different sectors, viz- Industrial Air Pollution, Residential Air Pollution, Vehicular Air Pollution, Environment, and Forest.
The source of the Data is [Real time Air Quality Index from various locations.](https://data.gov.in/resources/real-time-air-quality-index-various-locations/api#/Resource/get_resource_3b01bcb8_0b14_4abf_b6f2_c1bfd384ba69)
*PS: The analysis is still in development and is being improved further with additional data*

A general overview on how the pollution level or the Air Quality Index varies across various days in a week. Additionally, how it changes during different times of days for various pollutants.
In addition to the above, we can identify and rank most polluted cities, states. Get details on cities with lowest pollution levels. We were also able to identify the major constituents of Air Pollution that deteroriate the Air Quality Index.
